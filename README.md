BREAST CANCER PREDICTION WITH MULTIPLE MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS IN PYTHON

This project is my first dive into the topic of Machine Learning for a summer internship with San Jose State University in 2025.

This program utilizes the Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Breast Cancer Dataset to train a Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest Model
to accurately predict whether the given attributes of a tumor are to be declared, "Malignant" or, "Benign."

The results of these predictions are visualized by a series of graphics such as correlation maps, a class distributions, a confusion matrix,
and  Receiver Operating Characteristic.
